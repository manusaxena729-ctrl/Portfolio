### :wave:About me 
I began my journey as a Digital Marketing Executive,  I specialize in optimizing dynamic, responsive, and user-friendly websites that align with clients' business goals. 📈 𝐒𝐄𝐎 & 𝐂𝐨𝐧𝐭𝐞𝐧𝐭 𝐌𝐚𝐫𝐤𝐞𝐭𝐢𝐧𝐠 – Optimizing websites and crafting strategies to rank for competitive keywords. Then I discovered my passion for quality assurance — making sure that even the best code results in a seamless, bug-free experience for users.

Now, as a QA Engineer, I combine my development background with a detail-oriented mindset to deliver high-quality software. I specialize in manual testing and have hands-on experience designing comprehensive test plans, executing test cases, and using tools like JIRA to manage bug tracking efficiently

In addition to manual testing, I have 6 months of automation experience using Selenium WebDriver with the TestNG framework in Java, enabling me to write and maintain automated test scripts for regression and smoke testing. This automation expertise helps accelerate release cycles and enhance overall test coverage.

Along with that, I’ve also been working on API testing using tools like Postman and Rest Assured. With Postman, I manually test APIs by sending different requests and checking the responses, headers, status codes, and data. It helps me quickly understand how the API behaves.

With Rest Assured, Recently I have started writing  automated scripts to test APIs, which is useful for running tests regularly and saving time. These tools help make sure the backend of the application works correctly, handles errors well, and gives the right results.

From functional and UI testing to regression and exploratory testing, I ensure that every aspect of the software is tested thoroughly. My unique blend of skills allows me to approach testing with a developer’s eye and a tester’s discipline

💡 My goal is To ensure every release is smooth, every user is satisfied, and every bug is caught before it reaches production.
