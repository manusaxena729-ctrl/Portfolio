## About me :wave:
I began my journey as a Digital Marketing Executive, specializing in optimizing dynamic, responsive, and user-friendly websites aligned with clients’ business goals. 📈 SEO & Content Marketing involved optimizing websites and crafting strategies to rank for competitive keywords. Over time, I discovered my passion for quality assurance—ensuring that even the best code delivers a seamless, bug-free experience for users.

Now, as a QA Engineer, I focus on accuracy and usability, validating applications to ensure they meet functional and business requirements. I specialize in manual testing and have hands-on experience designing comprehensive test plans, executing test cases, and using tools like JIRA to manage bug tracking efficiently.

In addition to manual testing, I have four months of experience in test automation using Selenium WebDriver with Java, enabling me to write and maintain automated test scripts for regression and smoke testing. This automation expertise helps accelerate release cycles and enhance overall test coverage.

Along with this, I have been working on API testing using tools such as Postman. With Postman, I perform manual API testing by sending various requests and validating responses, headers, status codes, and data. This helps me quickly understand API behavior and ensure reliability.

With Rest Assured, I have recently started a course where I write automated scripts to test APIs, which is useful for running tests regularly and saving time. These tools help ensure that the backend of the application functions correctly, handles errors effectively, and returns accurate results.

# Performance Testing with JMeter:
I use Apache JMeter to simulate different user loads, measure response times, and identify performance bottlenecks. This allows me to evaluate system stability, scalability, and overall performance by creating load, stress, and endurance test scenarios and analyzing detailed performance reports.

# Load Testing with Page Load Timer (Chrome Extension):
For quick frontend performance checks, I use the Page Load Timer extension to measure page load times, including DOM and full load durations. This helps me identify UI performance issues early and ensure smooth, fast user experiences.

From functional and UI testing to regression and exploratory testing, I ensure that every aspect of the software is thoroughly tested. My unique blend of skills allows me to approach testing with both a developer’s perspective and a tester’s discipline.

💡My goal is to ensure that every release is smooth, every user is satisfied, and every bug is caught before it reaches production.
